% ECEF2LLA - convert earth-centered earth-fixed (ECEF)
%            cartesian coordinates to latitude, longitude,
%            and altitude
%
% USAGE:
% [lat,lon,alt] = ecef2lla(x,y,z)
%
% lat = geodetic latitude (radians)
% lon = longitude (radians)
% alt = height above WGS84 ellipsoid (m)
% x = ECEF X-coordinate (m)
% y = ECEF Y-coordinate (m)
% z = ECEF Z-coordinate (m)
%
% Notes: (1) This function assumes the WGS84 model.
%        (2) Latitude is customary geodetic (not geocentric).
%        (3) Inputs may be scalars, vectors, or matrices of the same
%            size and shape. Outputs will have that same size and shape.
%        (4) Tested but no warranty; use at your own risk.
